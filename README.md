## About The Project
Our project was made externaly for Future Place Leadership as a dashboard collecting data of job listings in Sweden. The data is collected from three websites which are LinkedIn, Platsbanken and LedigaJobb. Lastly, the information extracted from the ads is: employement type, duration, publication date, profession, county, job requirements, years of experience and seniority.

Python packages used:
[requirements.txt](https://github.com/DiaHassan/II1305-Team-Echo/blob/main/requirements.txt)

To install all dependencies using pip, run: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
[Early draft]  
In order for the project to work, the files in [/Project/code](https://github.com/DiaHassan/II1305-Team-Echo/tree/main/Project/code) and [/Project/db](https://github.com/DiaHassan/II1305-Team-Echo/tree/main/Project/db) should be run from the root directory. An example of running [```webscrape.py```](https://github.com/DiaHassan/II1305-Team-Echo/blob/main/Project/code/webscrape.py) from root directory, provided if the root directory is named "Root":  
```
C:\Users\example\Desktop\Root> python Project/code/webscrape.py
```
By running ```webscrape.py```, the program will scrape the data from the specified websites and create a database file called ```echo.db```. Estimated scraping times: ~1 min for Platsbanken, ~15 min for LedigaJobb and ~4.5 h for LinkedIn.
